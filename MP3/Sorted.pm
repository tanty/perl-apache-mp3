=head1 NAME

Apache::MP3::Sorted - Generate sorted streamable directories of MP3 files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # httpd.conf or srm.conf
 AddType audio/mpeg    mp3 MP3

 # httpd.conf or access.conf
 <Location /songs>
   SetHandler perl-script
   PerlHandler Apache::MP3::Sorted
   PerlSetVar  SortFields    Album,Title,-Duration
   PerlSetVar  Fields        Title,Artist,Album,Duration
 </Location>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Apache::MP3::Sorted subclasses Apache::MP3 to allow for sorting of MP3
listings by various criteria.  See L<Apache::MP3> for details on
installing and using.

=head1 CUSTOMIZING

This class adds one new Apache configuration variable, B<SortFields>.
This is a list of the names of the fields to sort by default when the
MP3 file listing is first displayed, after which the user can change
the sort field by clicking on the column headers.

=over 4

=item SortFields I<field>

The value of B<SortFields> may contain the names of any of the fields
in the listing, such as I<Title>, or I<Album> I<Duration>.  By
default, the sort direction will be alphabetically or numerically
ascending.  Reverse this by placing a "-" in front of the field name
(for symmetry, you can also prepend a "+" to signify normal ascending
order).  After the initial sort, the user can change the sort order by
clicking on the column headings of the file listing table.

Examples:

  PerlSetVar SortFields  Album,Title    # sort ascending by album, then title
  PerlSetVar SortFields  +Artist,-Kbps  # sort ascending by artist, descending by kbps

When constructing a playlist from a recursive directory listing,
sorting will be B<global> across all directories.  If no sort order is
specified, then the module reverts to sorting by file and directory
name.  A good value for SortFields is to sort by Artist,Album and
track:

  PerlSetVar SortFields Artist,Album,Track

Alternatively, you might want to sort by Description, which
effectively sorts by title, artist and album.

The following are valid fields:

    Field        Description

    album	 The album
    artist       The artist
    bitrate      Streaming rate of song in kbps
    comment      The comment field
    description	 Description, as controlled by DescriptionFormat
    duration     Duration of the song in hour, minute, second format
    filename	 The physical name of the .mp3 file
    genre        The genre
    samplerate   Sample rate, in KHz
    seconds      Duration of the song in seconds
    title        The title of the song
    track	 The track number

Field names are case insensitive.

=head1 METHODS

Apache::MP3::Sorted overrides the following methods:

 sort_mp3s()  mp3_table_header()   mp3_list_bottom()

It adds one new method:

=over 4

=item $field = $mp3->sort_fields

Returns a list of the names of the fields to sort on by default.
